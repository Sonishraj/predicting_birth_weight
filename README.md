# Low Birth Weight Prediction with Machine Learning Algorithms

<b>Objectives</b><br>

Based on the dataset, this algorithm predicts the possibility of low birth weight of a child.<br>

I used Logistic,Lasso and ARD Regression models. After training on the dataset, I predicted the Low Birth Weight data-set and compared it against the actual values. With this the accuracy of prediction was calculated. The Logistic(OLS) model is best with test score of 72.52%.<br>

<b> Programming Language Used</b> <br>
  
  1. Python <br>

<b>Run the script</b><br>

Clone the repository<br>

Open Jupyter notebook terminal and open birth_weight_prediction.ipynb

Locate the dataset(birthweight_low.xlsx) file location correctly in birth_weight_prediction.ipynb (line 9).
